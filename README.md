## Tribute to Punch Card Coders

My submission for [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) [Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). 

The premise of my project is: while coding can be difficult and frustrating we have it pretty good compared to programmers of previous generations. Let's pay a little tribute to them...
