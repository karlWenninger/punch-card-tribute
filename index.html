            Through the mid-1970s most computer data was input via punch cards. Blank cards were inserted into a punch machine with a qwerty style keyboard that converted alpha-numeric keystrokes to equivalent hole punches. The punched cards were then fed to a reader
            which output the data to a mainframe computer.

            Standardized punch cards consisted of 12 rows and 80 columns. Each column represented one character:
            <ul>
                <li>digits 0-9 were indicated by a single punch</li>
                <li>each letter received two punches per column</li>
                <li>special characters got from one to three punches</li>
            </ul>

            Until the widespread use of magnetic tape (no, not hard disks) user's programs were also <em>stored</em> on punch cards. Diagonal lines were commonly drawn by hand over the edge of a completed cardstack. If cards were inadvertently shuffled these
            marks were attempted to be realigned visually to get them in the correct order for the program to execute.

            So... the next time you're working on your retina display, mulit-core, WiFi connected laptop wondering why your latest project isn't behaving as you'd like remember that coding could be<em>—and used to be—</em>much harder.
