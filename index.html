            <p>Through the mid-1970s most computer data was input via punch cards. Blank cards were inserted into a
                punch machine with a qwerty style keyboard that converted alpha-numeric keystrokes to equivalent hole
                punches. The punched cards were then fed to a reader which output the data to a mainframe computer.</p>

            <p> Standardized punch cards consisted of 12 rows and 80 columns. Each column represented one character:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>digits 0-9 were indicated by a single punch</li>
                <li>letters received two punches per column</li>
                <li>special characters got from one to three punches</li>

            <p>Until the widespread use of magnetic tape (no, not hard disks) user's programs were also <em>stored</em>
                on punch cards.</p>
            <p>Diagonal lines were commonly drawn by hand over the edge of a completed deck. If cards were accidentally
                shuffled these marks were attempted to be visually realigned to get them in the correct order for the
                program to execute.</p>

            <p>So the next time you're cursing stackoverflow on your retina display, mulit-core, wifi connected laptop because
                your latest project isn't behaving as you'd like remember that coding could be<em>—and used to
                    be—</em>much harder.</p>

                fun and maybe try to punch out a for loop...
